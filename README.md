# Time Complexity + Recursion
Time Complexity PPT + Recursion code examples from the beginning of the year

[**Lucky Sum**](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/121/A) is a Codeforces problem that uses recursion and math. Check out:
- [**LuckyNumberGenerator.java**](https://github.com/PESH-Computer-Science/Time-Complexity-Recursion/blob/main/LuckyNumberGenerator.java) for the code to generate lucky numbers if you get stuck.
- [**LuckySum.java**](https://github.com/PESH-Computer-Science/Time-Complexity-Recursion/blob/main/LuckySum.java) contains the ***solution and explanation*** to the problem.

The other files contain recursion examples (fibonacci and factorials).
